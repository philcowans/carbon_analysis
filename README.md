# Carbon Analysis

Analysis of my household carbon footprint.

This is very much a work in progress, and I suspect the error bars are pretty large. The 'food' and 'other scope 3' categories are currently based on UK averages, but I'm planning to see if I can find a way to firm up the food emissions soon. Electricity is based on average UK carbon intensity. Flights are averaged over the year, otherwise you end up with big spikes in the months where we travel.

The latest version of the summary graph is at http://philcowans.com/total_emissions.png.
